# Open Joystick Display Server
*Joystick server that interfaces with Open Joystick Display*

This tool is useful if you have a seperate gaming and encoding PC. This allows you to broadcast your joystick inputs from your gaming PC over the LAN (or even the internet if you want to proxy) and have them appear on OJD on your encoding PC.
